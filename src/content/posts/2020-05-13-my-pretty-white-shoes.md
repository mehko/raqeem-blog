**Blockchain Token and evolution of the web:**

If we compare web3.0 generation to web1.0 and web2.0:

* Web1: Read
* Web2: Read, write
* Web3: Read, write, own

– Web1 (1990-early 2000s) was read-only. People consumed static webpages that they navigated to from directories like Yahoo. Web1 was built on open-source protocols like HTML.

– Web2 (early 2000s-today) is read and write. People create and consume content on the social platforms that we’re all familiar with. In web2, tech giants extract value from users by sitting in the middle. Web2 is built on client-server architecture where users are the client, and companies control the servers.

Web3 (2020+) is read, write, and own. People create, consume, and own the upside of their work through tokens.

– Web3 is built on peer-to-peer networks of computers that talk to each other without middlemen.

**What is a token?**

A token is a record of ownership of an asset.

Tokens can be fungible or non-fungible:

* Fungible tokens are interchangeable (e.g., the US dollar, bitcoin).
* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique (e.g a piece of digital art).
