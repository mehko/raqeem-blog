Let's talk about the Internet of Value, specifically how a token can become valuable or how to create a token and what the different types of tokens that exist on blockchain technologies.

## Evolutions of web

* **1990** creation of the internet: transmitting information has never been so easy

Transferring information that was originally communicated in the press has never been easier thanks to email, websites, blogs …

* **2008** arrival of Bitcoin and blockchain technology: transferring value has never been easier.

Transferring value that was initially only possible through an intermediary (trusted third party, banks etc.) is now possible thanks to Token transfer via blockchain technology.

*A token takes value first when it has a use, it is the supply and demand that will define its value.*

* **2015** came to Ethereum and smart contracts: It was built based on the same blockchain protocol as Bitcoin, and it is now possible to execute smart contracts.

Smart contracts are computer codes that can be executed within the Ethereum blockchain. The code is independent, searchable, and immutable, which means that it cannot be modified.

## A simple line of code

Your money is a line of code, the dollar of your bank account is a token, which means that it is a line of code compatible with your bank's network.

Let's take the case of the US Dollar to transfer 1 USD from bank A to bank B, it will be necessary to change the network of the central bank, which will credit bank B with 1 USD.

To return to the "Token" Dollar its code and its rules of operation which govern the creation of money and the interest rate of the central bank are unknown to most people.

Its rules evolve regularly according to the laws and regulations.

Basically we already use tokens without knowing it and without knowing its code and how it works in detail.

## The blockchain token

A blockchain token is generally defined by its quantity in circulation (supply), the rules of manufacture and destruction (mint and burn), the operation and its uses (utility), the rules of sharing and reversals (tokenomics). All these rules are written in a computer code called smart contract. It is readable because the computer code is accessible to developers, we can deduce the rules. It is immutable because once registered in the blockchain it cannot be modified. This makes it reliable.

There are several types of tokens, the most famous are:

* Fungible Tokens or “ERC20” (Ethereum blockchain)

The US Dollar is fungible because it is interchangeable 1 USD equals 1 other USD: if you buy an item for 5 USD in a store and you decide to get your money back a few days later, you will get 5 USD back, not necessarily the 5 USD you gave. It is therefore fungible.

* Non-Fungible Tokens or “ERC721” (Ethereum blockchain)

A real estate is non-fungible it is not interchangeable, a house near the coast cannot be exchanged by another house in the country, the appreciation of the property can change according to the people as well as the offer and the demand, it is necessary to estimate it by a fungible value (like the fiat money).

## Use cases of crypto assets and utilities in the halal economy

For the case of the non-fungible token, it is a unique token that can be representative of a certificate of ownership or authenticity of a physical or virtual product. We can apply it to halal certificates, it will guarantee immutability and transparency which will increase consumer confidence.

In the case of the fungible token it could be considered as a currency of exchange within a service related to the halal economy, it will have to provide certain benefits.

Crypto assets are exchangeable 24/7 without intermediaries in a transparent and secure way.

We have just talked about the Internet of Value, like transferring and exchanging value whether it is a physical product or a service, without altering its proper value between several people from country to country in a few seconds without any intermediary. The possibilities are multiple and limitless, our imagination could build future use cases to make the halal economy evolve.

*The best way to predict the future is to build it yourself*
